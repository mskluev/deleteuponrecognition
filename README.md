# deleteuponrecognition

A series of small example projects using various technologies primarily geared towards helping me remember things I already learned and subsequently purged from my mind due to space issues.

I have a habit of dabbling in a new technology enough to do some basic tasks then getting either pulled in another direction or distracted by something shiny. Hopefully this journal of examples will help me if I ever need to come back to it. Maybe this will even help someone else or get some feedback for improvement.
